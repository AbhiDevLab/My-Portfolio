My-Portfolio
A personal developer portfolio built with React, Vite, and Three.js. It showcases interactive 3D models (GLB format) as a visual backdrop while highlighting the developer’s skills and projects. The site includes dedicated sections for the tech stack, work experience, project highlights, and a downloadable resume (PDF). A clean, professional design ensures that information is presented clearly and concisely, following recommended best practices.

1. 3D Animations: Interactive 3D GLB models rendered with Three.js for an engaging visual effect.
2. Tech Stack: A dedicated section listing all core technologies (e.g. React, Vite, Three.js, etc.) used in the project.
3. Work Experience & Projects: Sections detailing the developer’s professional background and showcasing notable projects.
4. Resume Download: A PDF version of the resume is included in the public assets for easy access.
5. Contact Form: A functional form allowing visitors to send messages directly to the developer.
